# Contributing news content

Please review [template.md](template.md) for a sample layout and structure of a post. You can use standard Markdown to write your material (which includes HTML as well, see [Daring Fireball's][df] syntax guide for Markdown for more information).

There are also some specific Jekyll related formatting and syntax you can use such as highlighting code blocks, read [Jekyll's documentation][jkdoc] for help. Jekyll makes use of the Liquid templating language. You only need concern youself with [small amount](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) of its documentation.

The RSS feed is automatically built from the list of posts and added to ``feed.xml``. Can be accessed by ``/feed.xml``.

Please use the date formatting "FullYear-Month-Day" for both the naming of files and/or the date within the post's YAML, example file name: 2014-08-18-title-of-post.md

# Modifying layouts, includes, etc

* ``_includes/`` contains snippets that are included upon generation of the site itself in the layouts. This involves the ``<head>``, site header, navigation, and footer (only seen at bottom of individual post page). Changing these will change them throughout the site.
* ``_layouts/`` contains the two primary layouts that build the structure of the site itself. ``default.html`` is the base structure which everything is built off of. ``post.html`` is the structure for individual posts.
* ``main.css`` is the primary stylesheet for the entire site. ``syntax.css`` is the stylesheet for code blocks (``<pre><code>``). Please refrain from modifying ``syntax.css``.
* ``_data/`` contains YAML files that are used site wide, such as the Navigation or the Officers. Used by writing ``site.data.yamlfile``.
* ``_config.yaml`` contains all the important variables for the site itself. Such as where the build destination is, title of the organization, and more.
