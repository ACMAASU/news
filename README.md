Please review [template.md](template.md) for a sample layout and structure of a post. You can use standard Markdown to write your material (which includes HTML as well, see [Daring Fireball's][df] syntax guide for Markdown for more information).

To label your post please use the date formatting "Year-Month-Day" for both the naming of files and the date within the post YAML, example file name: 2014-08-18-title-of-post.md
